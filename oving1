# Calculate annual traffic insurance fee (assuming 365 days in a year)
traffic_insurance_fee_annual = traffic_insurance_fee_per_day * 365

# Calculate annual costs for electric car
annual_cost_electric = (
    insurance_electric +
    traffic_insurance_fee_annual +
    (electricity_consumption_per_km * electricity_price_per_kwh * km_per_year) +
    (toll_fee_electric_per_km * km_per_year)
)

# Calculate annual costs for gasoline car
annual_cost_gasoline = (

    (gasoline_cost_per_km * km_per_year) +
    (toll_fee_gasoline_per_km * km_per_year)

# Calculate annual cost difference
annual_cost_difference = annual_cost_gasoline - annual_cost_electric
